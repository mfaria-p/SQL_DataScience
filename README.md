# SQL for Data Science - Course Projects

This project showcases the work I completed during the **SQL for Data Science** course offered by IBM on edX. It includes various exercises and projects demonstrating my learning journey with SQL and Python for database management and analysis.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to reflect my progression in the course, starting with **MySQL** and later transitioning to **SQLite and Python**. The initial theoretical modules focus on MySQL syntax, where I used **phpMyAdmin** to create and manage databases using SQL scripts. Later, I shifted my focus to Python and Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis with SQLite, leading to the projects shown in the practical implementation. Although the course primarily utilized Jupyter Notebook, I chose to complete all Python-related projects in **Google Colab**, as I am more familiar with that environment.

### **Key Learning Areas:**

- **MySQL Database Management:** Creating, modifying, and deleting tables using SQL scripts in **phpMyAdmin**.
- **SQL Query Techniques:** Refining query results using string patterns, sorting, grouping, and built-in database functions.
- **Working with Multiple Tables:** Using **subqueries, joins, and nested selects** to retrieve meaningful data.
- **Metadata Retrieval:** Extracting database schema information from MySQL and SQLite.
- **Python & SQLite Integration:** Managing SQLite databases using Python with **DB-API, SQL Magic, and Pandas**.
- **Real-World Data Analysis:** Applying SQL and Python to analyze datasets from Chicago Public Schools and socioeconomic indicators.

## **Learning Outcomes**

By working through this project, I gained:

- Hands-on experience with **MySQL, SQLite, and Python** for database management.
- A strong understanding of **SQL queries, data extraction, and data analysis**.
- Practical skills in analyzing **real-world datasets** using SQL and Python.

This project serves as a portfolio of my SQL and Python database management skills developed through the course.
